**Currently requires using UDONSharp. CyanTriggers and Graph support requires using the wrapper version in place of the UDONSharp version of the prefab!**

# What is Combat Link?
Combat Link is a system/standard in which allows a world to give your avatar's HUD data, such as your health, status effects, and other information. All in a prefab you can stick on your avatar!

# Who made made it? Why?
I (Snipeslow) started this project a long time ago when I noticed a shader based workaround (popularized by AudioLink's method) to get data to avatars. Made easier with an official VRC update that introduced the method in a more proper manner. However, it took a long time to figure out how to make a screen space HUD, due to not understanding matrices until recently (even then, it's still an eldritch thing to me). I made the system to be used by the Avatar PVP community, free. And other communities too.

# Can you make *X* hud from *X* game?
I do not take requests. BUT I am willing to teach, either through video tutorials or direct teaching if I spot ya in a voice channel. Planned HUDs I will have outright are:
- Space Commando
- Space Guardian
- Hazard Suit
- My Example HUD

# Can you make a Dead Space style health bar?
No, due to how Combat Link sends data. There might be a way to do it later, but I will have to research it.

# Features
- Health Bar
- Auxiliary Health Bar (Or Shield in some contexts, like Halo. Or Armor, like in Half Life 2)
- Minimap Support
- Oxygen Bar
- Temperature Bar
- Status Effect Icons

# Credits
- Snipeslow, the main coder
- error.mdl, their original hud served as an inspiration
- GoFluffYaself, Avatar PVP creator
